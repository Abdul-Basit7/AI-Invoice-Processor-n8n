# üìå Project: AI Invoice Processor (n8n)

## Description  
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting and summarizing invoice or receipt data sent via Telegram.  
It uses **OCR** to read the contents of an image, formats the extracted text into a clean summary, and sends it back to the user on Telegram.  
The workflow also uploads the original file to **Google Drive** for storage. It is designed for **Pakistani receipts**, using `Rs.` as the currency format, and includes clear separators for each item in the output.
